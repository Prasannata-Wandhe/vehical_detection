# Vehicle Distance Measurement System

## 1. Introduction

This project implements a real-time vehicle distance measurement system designed for in-vehicle dashcam applications. Using YOLOv12 object detection and monocular depth estimation through perspective geometry, the system calculates distances to surrounding vehicles with region-specific warning systems. The system monitors three ROI lanes (LEFT, MAIN, RIGHT) and automatically blurs vehicle plates for GDPR compliance, providing an adaptable safety assistance system for autonomous vehicles and advanced driver monitoring.

**Core Features:**
- Real-time multi-vehicle detection using YOLOv12
- Accurate distance calculation through perspective projection
- Three-zone ROI monitoring (LEFT, MAIN, RIGHT lanes)
- Adaptable warning thresholds per lane
- Automatic vehicle plate detection and blurring
- Color-coded distance visualization
- Live safety indicators
- Annotated video recording

## 2. Methodology / Approach

The system employs a multi-component architecture combining object detection, perspective geometry, and region-based analysis:

**Object Detection:** YOLOv12 detects vehicles (cars, motorcycles, buses, trucks) and vehicle plates in real-time with high confidence.

**Distance Estimation:** Uses monocular depth estimation via perspective projection, calculating distance from bounding box height using calibrated focal length and known vehicle dimensions.

**ROI Zone Analysis:** Frame divided into three trapezoidal regions (LEFT, MAIN, RIGHT) with separate warning thresholds and display limits for context-aware alerting.

**Privacy Protection:** Automatic vehicle plate detection and Gaussian blurring for regulatory compliance.

**Adaptive Visualization:** Color-coded distance labels (red for warnings, green for safe) with zone-specific thresholds.

6. Apply perspective distortion correction based on offset
7. Detect vehicle plates within vehicle regions
8. Apply Gaussian blur to vehicle plates
9. Evaluate distance against zone-specific warning threshold
10. Color-code distance label (RED/GREEN) accordingly
11. Overlay distance text and warning indicators
12. Record annotated frame to output video

## 3. Mathematical Framework

### 3.1 Perspective Projection Distance Calculation

The fundamental equation relating observed bounding box height to actual distance:

$$d = \frac{h_{\text{real}} \cdot f}{h_{\text{image}}}$$

where:
- $d$ = distance from camera to vehicle (meters)
- $h_{\text{real}}$ = actual vehicle height (meters)
- $f$ = camera focal length (pixels)
- $h_{\text{image}}$ = bounding box height in pixels

### 3.2 ROI Zone Definition

Three trapezoidal regions for multi-lane monitoring (2042×1148 resolution):

$$\mathbf{ROI}_{\text{LEFT}} = \{(x, y) : (x, y) \in \text{Polygon}([[240, 600], [925, 550], [312, 1100], [100, 1100]])\}$$

$$\mathbf{ROI}_{\text{MAIN}} = \{(x, y) : (x, y) \in \text{Polygon}([[925, 550], [1025, 550], [1712, 1100], [312, 1100]])\}$$

$$\mathbf{ROI}_{\text{RIGHT}} = \{(x, y) : (x, y) \in \text{Polygon}([[1025, 550], [1802, 600], [1942, 1100], [1712, 1100]])\}$$

### 3.3 Vehicle Height Classification

Reference heights for distance calculation by vehicle type:

$$H_{\text{vehicle}} = \begin{cases}
1.55 \text{ m} & \text{if class ID} = 2 \text{ (Car)} \\
1.2 \text{ m} & \text{if class ID} = 3 \text{ (Motorcycle)} \\
3.0 \text{ m} & \text{if class ID} = 5 \text{ (Bus)} \\
2.5 \text{ m} & \text{if class ID} = 7 \text{ (Truck)}
\end{cases}$$

### 3.4 Perspective Distortion Correction

Correction factor for off-center vehicles due to perspective distortion:

$$d_{\text{corrected}} = d \cdot (1 + \alpha \cdot \delta)$$

where:
- $\alpha = 0.0001$ (displacement coefficient)
- $\delta$ = Euclidean distance from optical center to vehicle center

$$\delta = \sqrt{(x_{\text{vehicle}} - x_{\text{center}})^2 + (y_{\text{vehicle}} - y_{\text{center}})^2}$$
